# Intro to CNN
## This code of CNN will help you to understand the various functionalties that will be used in Deep Neural Networks
### play with the model paramters and functionalties to see how a network behaves, for eg
  - Changing the loss function (knowing why which loss function to apply at what time)
  - Changing Batch Size
  - playing with RELU before prediction layers
  - understanding the importance of learning rate
  - importance of reduction paramter in Loss function

Finally The model has been able to achieve a total of 98% accuracy on an MNIST dataset
